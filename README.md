# WebNavigation
My dissertation.

This project explores the effectiveness of using a new style of web navigation instead of a horizontal navigation bar like on the majority of websites.

The navigation uses the Threejs library.

To run the project, navigate to the root directory in a terminal and run the Python command (if Python is installed):
py -m http.server
and go to the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/html
