The code needs to be run locally on your computer due to a security measure in browsers.

To start an internal server using Python, navigate to the 'Navigation' folder in the command line and type 'py -m http.server' and go to web address 127.0.0.1:8000.

Other scripts can be run for other languages and can be found here:

I have three different code scenarios for three different navigation systems that copy the links of 3 websites. The only difference is the number of layers and links in each example.

All examples are in folder /html/

One example is called siegelGale.html
Another is called aiven.html
Another is called solopress.html

They copy the links from:
http://www.siegelgale.com/
https://aiven.io/
https://www.solopress.com/
